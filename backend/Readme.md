Backend Folder

This folder contains the backend files for my project. It is built using Node.js and utilizes various libraries and frameworks.

To get started, follow the steps below:

    1. Make sure you have Node.js installed on your system.
    2. Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the backend folder.
    3. Run the command 'npm install' to install the required dependencies.
    4. Once the installation is complete, you can start the project by running 'npm run dev'.
    5. The project will start, and you should see a message indicating that the server is running on a specific port (5000).

Make sure to have the necessary environment variables configured, as some dependencies may require them.

Please note that the 'npm run dev' command is used to start the project in a development environment. You may need to modify the configuration or scripts depending on your specific requirements.

If you encounter any issues or have any questions, feel free to reach out to me.

Happy coding!
